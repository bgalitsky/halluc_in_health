%Symptoms of acute gout:

%In most cases, only one or a few joints are affected. The big toe, knee, or ankle joints are most often affected.
%Sometimes many joints become swollen and painful.
%The pain starts suddenly, often during the night. Pain is often severe, described as throbbing, crushing, or excruciating.
%The joint appears warm and red. It is most often very tender and swollen (it hurts to put a sheet or blanket over it).
%There may be a fever.
%The attack may go away in a few days, but may return from time to time. Additional attacks often last longer.
