You are an RST discourse parser.
Segment the following text into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs).
Then build an RST tree in this explicit Python dict format:

{{
  "edu": <text of nucleus EDU or None>,
  "relation": <RST relation label or None>,
  "nucleus": <subtree or None>,
  "satellites": [
      {{

Rules:
- Each EDU must appear exactly once in the tree.
- Satellites go inside the "satellites" list of their nucleus.
- The "dependent_satellites" list should contain EDUs that cannot stand alone.

    Discourse analysis is the study of how language is structured beyond the level of individual sentences. 
    It examines how sequences of sentences, paragraphs, and other textual units work together to create meaning, convey intentions, and guide the reader‚Äôs understanding. 
    Unlike traditional grammar analysis, which focuses on syntax and vocabulary, discourse analysis investigates how ideas are connected, how arguments are constructed, and how information is organized to achieve communicative goals.

    At its core, discourse analysis involves breaking down texts into smaller units called **Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs)**. 
    These units typically correspond to clauses or simple sentences that convey a single idea. 
    The relationships between EDUs are then analyzed to understand the **rhetorical structure** of the text. 
    One popular framework for this is **Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)**, which classifies relations between EDUs as either **nucleus** (central, essential information) or **satellite** (supporting, explanatory, or elaborative information).

    Discourse analysis is applied in a wide range of fields. 
    In **natural language processing (NLP)**, it helps machines understand the structure of texts, enabling tasks such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and question answering. 
    In **education and linguistics**, it provides insights into how arguments are formed, how narratives flow, and how coherence is maintained in writing. 
    In **business and law**, it can be used to analyze reports, contracts, or legal arguments to ensure clarity and logical consistency.

    By segmenting text into EDUs and mapping the relations between them, discourse analysis allows both humans and machines to capture the deeper meaning of a text, detect the logical flow of information, and identify which parts of the text are essential versus supportive. 
    This structured understanding is crucial for improving communication, automating text understanding, and supporting advanced AI applications.
